# Welcome to my Music Quiz project

## This project is my first one using JavaScript with HTML and CSS combined. The site have 6 questions with score count and alert when correct or wrong answer. The site also logs username and push it into an array that displays in the beginning and at the final page.

The sites goal is to be a fun and easy accesable quiz.
